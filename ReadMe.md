# CS 4042  Group Project

Data is sourced from: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/

All data so far is for Regular Season games.

Potential tasks:

Create a pipeline where the user can input what data they want / what visualisations they want / how to export the data.

1. Cleaning data:

- Some of the data has duplicates of player, because they player for multiple teams, can this data be combined?
- Some categories might not be as useful
- Allow sorting/filtering data by: MVP's only (and other awards), top 100 player, certain teams, conferences (East or West coast), position

2. Visualise data:

- Allow graphs of statistics (scatterpoint graphs) with a specified x and y axis
- Visualise specified players most common position as a half-court image with percentages (from shooting data)
- Use basic ML Model to identify most similar player in the data (does not have to be very accurate)

3. Export data as task specific CSV's
